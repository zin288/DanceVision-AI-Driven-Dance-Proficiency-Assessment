    "Dance is a universal language that transcends borders and cultures. It is not only a form of entertainment but also a medium for self-expression and communication. With the advent of technology, the way we perceive and interact with dance has evolved. The project at hand aims to leverage the power of machine learning and MediaPipe to detect and analyze dance poses, thereby determining the proficiency of a dancer. This technology can be utilized in various ways, such as an AI dance trainer, a tool for auditions, talent scouting, and entertainment.\n",

    "The online learning market has been rapidly expanding; in 2019, it was a USD 144 B industry, and by 2026, is expected to reach USD 374.3 B [1](#1) The impact of COVID-19 on dance education has been significant, with many institutions forced to close their doors and move their classes online. This has led to a surge in interest in online dance classes and the use of technology in dance education. However, the transition to online learning has also highlighted the limitations of current approaches, particularly in terms of providing effective feedback and supporting independent practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In the online environment, it is especially challenging to learn body activities, such as dancing or playing sports. For example, watching and following videos on YouTube provide convenient and easy opportunities to learn dance for beginners. However, the interactions between students and teachers are limited in this environment. Unlike offline dance classes where teachers and students are co-located simultaneously, beginners may not easily grasp visual cues in tutorial videos, and compare their movements with those in the videos.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the global dance and electronic music market revenue was estimated to be around 7.1 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 [2](#2), indicating a substantial market for this technology. Specifically, in South Korea, the K-pop industry is known for its rigorous dance routines and synchronization between band members. It is commonly used as a metrics in auditions as well. However, the time-consuming nature of traditional auditions may be taking up resources for entertainment companies and also applicants. These auditions often require significant travel and preparation time, making them inaccessible for many potential students. Additionally, the audition process can be highly subjective, with decisions often based on a single performance. These issues may be alleviated with the use of AI dance assessment. Talent scouts can use it to scan through numerous online videos efficiently as well in search of suitable candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent years have seen the growth of AI technologies in various domains, including dance. These technologies, such as human pose estimation models for 2D video, allow us to recognize dance movements and offer feedback to learners based on the captured movements. In addition, AI-based pose estimation is more lightweight and practical than other technologies for motion recognition, such as motion capture and Kinect, which are expensive, and have limited accessibility to being generally applied for students. Hence, this project aims to provide a light weight, accessible, one-of-its-kind time-specific AI dance trainer for all to use.\n",
